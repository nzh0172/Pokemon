# C++ Project: Pokemon (Text-based RPG)

This project is a simple implementation of a very popular RPG(Role-playing game) called Pokemon where your monsters known as Pokemon(Pocket Monster) battle wild Pokemons as a Pokemon trainer through turn-based combat. Here only the battle gameplay is implemented with C++ concepts that weâ€™ve learned so far in this course.
